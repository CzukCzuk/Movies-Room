# Projects

Movies Room is one of the most popular polish websites about movies, tv series, games and popculture.
As for my Project, I decided to test some of the most important features and functionalities of the website such as:

- Registration
- Logging in
- Writing a comment
- Search Bar
- Quizzes
- Displaying on various Web Browsers
- Visual and Functional aspects of: Main Page, Social Media Tab, Advertisement Tab, Personal Data Tab and Ranking.
